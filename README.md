### Project Description
Ever caught yourself yawning in the middle of a Zoom meeting or in work? 😴 This app is here to catch you in the act! 📸 Using AI magic 🪄 and your webcam 📷, it detects yawns in real-time, plays a warning beep 🔔, and even flashes a red alert 🚨 if you yawn twice. Perfect for sleepy coders, night owls 🦉, and online class survivors! 🎓

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People yawn. A lot. 😪 Especially during online meetings, late-night coding sessions, or that one boring lecture we all know about 🥱. But what if… someone stopped you from yawning? 🤯 Nobody asked for it, but here we are — solving a problem that was never a problem in the first place! 🚀

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing The Yawn Detector Pro — the Streamlit AI that spies on your face through your webcam 👀, catches your yawns in 4K 😴📸, blasts a sound to shame you 🔊, and if you dare yawn twice… boom! 🚨 Red Alert Mode with a funny roast message. It even saves screenshots so you can relive your sleepy crimes forever 💤📂.
